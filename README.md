# dull

A new approach to building Shiny applications.

dull is built on top of shiny and bootstrap 4 among other icon and javascript
libraries. This package provides new takes on many of the functionalities 
found in shiny. The user may find some aspects of the provided functions 
frustrating to begin with, for example there are no explict `*Input` functions
as there are in shiny. Instead, all UI functions include a `...` argument, thus
by passing an `id` argument many elements may be transformed into reactive 
inputs.

While shiny has, in my opinion and rightfully so, remained accessible to new
users as new capabilities were added, dull is an effort to provide the user
more flexibility and open up new creative possibilities for shiny based 
applications. Additionally, I believe shiny's evolution over time has locked in
some paradigms that might otherwise be removed with a clean slate.

dull is not intended to replace shiny, instead I hope dull is a breath of fresh
air and an exciting new tool for those who have desired more flexibilty out of
shiny.
