# yonder

A reactive web framework built on [shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny).

## Introduction

the UI side yonder features refreshed IonRange sliders, new reactive inputs such as
`navInput()` and `dropdownInput()`, and Bootstrap 4.2. On the server side yonder
includes tools for showing alerts and toasts, displaying modal and popovers,
validating and freezing input values, hiding and showing panes of content, and more!
