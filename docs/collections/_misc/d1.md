  title: Text and Heading Styles
  description: |-
    These function encapsulate Bootstrap classes for styling text and headings.
    Display headings are not meant to replace the standard HTML heading tags,
    they are a stand out alternative for eye-catching titles. Use `lead` to
    emphasize a paragraph or snippet of text.

    `mark` and `small` are HTML class-based alternatives to `<mark>` and
    `<small>`. Typically, `<mark>` is used to indicate relevance. By using
    Bootstrap's class alternatives one can utilize the highlighting aspect
    of `<mark>` while avoiding the usage and purpose restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: '...'
    description: |-
      Child elements or named arguments passed as HTML attributes
      to the parent element.
